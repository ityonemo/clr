## Fix: Create/free method mismatch not detected after bitcast

**Date:** 2026-03-31

**Symptom:**
When allocating with `create(u8)` and freeing with `free(slice)` after a bitcast from `*u8` to `*[1]u8`, the analyzer reported "memory leak" instead of "allocation method mismatch".

**Root Cause:**
The `is_slice` check in `handleAllocDestroy` and `handleAllocFree` derived the allocation method from the current refinement structure (`pointee.* == .region` = slice). When bitcast converted `*u8` (pointer → scalar) to `*[1]u8` (pointer → region → scalar), the structure changed, making the analyzer think a single-item `create` allocation was now a slice allocation.

**When This Happens:**
- Allocate with `allocator.create(u8)` → returns `*u8`
- Cast to `*[1]u8` via `@ptrCast` → bitcast wraps scalar in region
- Convert to slice via array coercion → `[]u8`
- Free with `allocator.free(slice)` → analyzer sees region, thinks it's slice allocation

**Key Insight:**
The allocation method is determined by the TYPE of allocation:
- `create` ALWAYS returns pointer → scalar/struct (single item)
- `alloc` ALWAYS returns pointer → region → element (slice)

Therefore, WHERE the `.allocated` metadata lives tells us the allocation method:
- `.allocated` on region → real `alloc` allocation
- `.allocated` on element (scalar/struct) with no `.allocated` on region → `create` allocation (possibly wrapped by bitcast)

**The Fix:**
1. When bitcast wraps a scalar in a region (converting `*T` to `[*]T`), the region is created WITHOUT allocation metadata
2. The original scalar keeps its `.allocated` metadata from `create`
3. In `handleAllocFree`, detect mismatch by checking structure:
   - If region has `.allocated` → it's a real `alloc` allocation → OK for `free`
   - If region has NO `.allocated` but element does → it's a `create` allocation wrapped by bitcast → MISMATCH
4. Same logic in `handleAllocDestroy` for the reverse case

This approach requires no additional fields - the refinement structure itself encodes the allocation method.

**Key Files Changed:**
- `lib/analysis/memory_safety.zig` - Updated `handleAllocFree` and `handleAllocDestroy` to detect mismatch via structure
- `lib/tag.zig` - Ensure bitcast does NOT copy allocation metadata to new region wrapper

**Test Case:** `test/cases/allocator_safety/basic/create_free_mismatch.zig` (test #25)

## Fix: clearAllocationMetadata must use .unset instead of null

**Date:** 2026-03-17

**Commit:** a517cf4

**Symptom:**
When running the vendor wrapper, panic occurred: `memory_safety must be set on scalars (gid=1370)` in `testValid`.

**Root Cause:**
The `clearAllocationMetadata` function in `lib/analysis/memory_safety.zig` was setting `memory_safety = null` on refinements when clearing phantom allocation metadata on error paths.

**When This Happens:**
When an error union's payload contains an allocation (like `allocator.create(u8)` returning `!*u8`), and the error path is taken, the analysis needs to clear the "phantom" allocation metadata from the payload - because on the error path, the allocation never actually happened.

**The Problem:**
The `testValid` invariant requires ALL scalars to have `memory_safety` set (not null). By setting `memory_safety = null`, `clearAllocationMetadata` violated this invariant. When the error path merged back and `testValid` was called, it found scalars with `memory_safety = null` and panicked.

**The Fix:**
Changed `clearAllocationMetadata` to set `memory_safety = .{ .unset = {} }` instead of `null`. The `.unset` variant means "no active allocation tracking" while still satisfying the invariant that memory_safety must be set.

For error unions specifically, we use `.error_stub` instead of `.unset` since that's the expected state for error union containers.

**Code Change (line 643 example):**
```zig
// Before (wrong):
.scalar => |*s| s.analyte.memory_safety = null,

// After (correct):
.scalar => |*s| s.analyte.memory_safety = .{ .unset = {} },
```

## Fix: ArrayElemVal must handle interned sources

**Date:** 2026-03-17

**Commit:** 53e4fc6

**Symptom:**
When running the GPA error path test, panic occurred: `interned source not implemented` in ArrayElemVal tag handler.

**Root Cause:**
The `ArrayElemVal` tag handler in `lib/tag.zig` only handled `.inst` sources (AIR instruction references) but not `.interned` sources (comptime-known values from the InternPool).

**When This Happens:**
When code iterates over comptime-known arrays. GPA's `detectLeaks` function iterates over bucket arrays that are comptime-known, generating `array_elem_val` instructions with interned sources.

**The Problem:**
The handler would panic on any `.interned` source because it was marked as unimplemented. For comptime arrays, we need to either find an existing global refinement for the interned value, or create a new refinement based on the element type.

**The Fix:**
Added handling for `.interned` sources in ArrayElemVal:
1. First try to look up an existing global refinement via `refinements.getGlobal(interned.ip_idx)`
2. If not found, extract the element type from the interned type info
3. Create a new refinement using `typeToRefinement` for the element type
4. Mark it as defined via `splatInitDefined` (comptime values are always defined)

**Code Change:**
```zig
.interned => |interned| blk: {
    // Try to find existing global first
    if (state.refinements.getGlobal(interned.ip_idx)) |gid| {
        break :blk gid;
    }
    // Create element from type for comptime arrays
    const element_type = switch (interned.ty) {
        .region => |elem| elem.*,
        .pointer => |inner| switch (inner.*) {
            .region => |elem| elem.*,
            else => @panic("ArrayElemVal: interned pointer must point to region"),
        },
        else => @panic("ArrayElemVal: interned type must be region or pointer to region"),
    };
    const element_ref = try typeToRefinement(element_type, state.refinements);
    const element_gid = try state.refinements.appendEntity(element_ref);
    splatInitDefined(state.refinements, element_gid, state.ctx);
    state.results[index].refinement = element_gid;
    try splat(.array_elem_val, state, index, self);
    return;
},
```

## Fix: Store handler must call splat BEFORE structural updates

**Date:** 2026-03-18

**Commit:** 6f5650a

**Symptom:**
False positive "use of undefined value" errors when storing a struct value into a struct field, specifically when using `return .{ .inner = inner }` patterns. Observed with `std.fs.File.deprecatedReader()` which stores a File struct into a GenericReader.context field.

**Root Cause:**
The `Store.apply` handler in `lib/tag.zig` was modifying `ptr_ref.pointer.to` to point to the source struct BEFORE calling `splat(.store)`. When `undefined_safety.store` ran, it would read the already-modified pointer and copy undefined state from source to source (a no-op), instead of from source to destination.

**When This Happens:**
When storing a struct value into a struct field via ret_ptr/struct_field_ptr pattern:
1. `ret_ptr` creates a struct (e.g., GenericReader) with fields marked as undefined
2. `struct_field_ptr` gets pointer to a field (e.g., GenericReader.context, a File struct)
3. `store` should copy undefined state from arg (defined File) to the field (undefined File)

**The Problem:**
In `Store.apply`:
```zig
// Store tag handler modified ptr.to HERE (line 1262)
if (src.* == .@"struct") {
    ptr_ref.pointer.to = src_ref;  // Now points to SOURCE
}
// Then called splat (line 1275)
try splat(.store, state, index, self);  // undefined_safety reads modified ptr.to
```

When `undefined_safety.store` ran:
- It read `ptr_ref.pointer.to` which was now the source GID
- Called `copyUndefinedStateRecursive(dst=source, src=source)` - a no-op!
- The original destination (inside GenericReader) retained its undefined state

**The Fix:**
Call `splat(.store)` BEFORE the structural updates:
```zig
// Call splat FIRST (analyses see original destination)
if (!is_allocator) {
    try splat(.store, state, index, self);
}

// THEN update structural fields
if (src.* == .@"struct") {
    ptr_ref.pointer.to = src_ref;
}
```

Special case for allocator: the allocator path calls splat after because it uses a different update pattern (direct reference).

**Test Case:** `test/cases/store_struct_field_preserves_state.zig`

## Fix: Allocator struct fields must emit .allocator type, not .@"struct"

**Date:** 2026-03-21

**Symptom:**
When running the ForestMQ vendor wrapper (or any code storing an allocator in a struct field), panic occurred: `access of union field 'struct' while field 'allocator' is active` in `copyUndefinedState`.

**Root Cause:**
In `src/codegen.zig`, the `typeToStringLookupNoNames` and `typeToStringLookup` functions generate type representations for struct fields. When a field's type is `std.mem.Allocator`, these functions were generating `.@"struct"` instead of `.allocator`.

**When This Happens:**
When a struct contains an `std.mem.Allocator` field (a very common Zig pattern):
```zig
const Container = struct {
    allocator: std.mem.Allocator,
    data: u32,
};
```

The codegen would emit:
```zig
.{ .@"struct" = &.{ .type_id = X, .fields = &.{ .{ .@"struct" = ... }, .{ .scalar = {} } } } }
//                                                   ^^^^^^^^^ WRONG
```

Instead of:
```zig
.{ .@"struct" = &.{ .type_id = X, .fields = &.{ .{ .allocator = Y }, .{ .scalar = {} } } } }
//                                                   ^^^^^^^^^ CORRECT
```

**The Problem:**
The `.struct_type` handling in both `typeToStringLookupNoNames` and `typeToStringLookup` immediately delegated to `structTypeToStringSimple` / `structTypeToString` without first checking if the struct type is the well-known `std.mem.Allocator` type.

The `isAllocatorType` function existed and correctly identified allocator types by checking if the struct name is `"mem.Allocator"`, but it wasn't being called in the struct type conversion path.

**The Fix:**
Added `isAllocatorType(ip, ty)` check at the beginning of both `.struct_type` cases:

```zig
.struct_type => blk: {
    // Check for well-known struct type: std.mem.Allocator
    if (isAllocatorType(ip, ty)) {
        break :blk formatAllocatorType(arena, @intFromEnum(ty));
    }
    // ... existing struct handling
}
```

Also added a testable helper `formatAllocatorType()` that generates the allocator type string.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/codegen.zig` - Added `formatAllocatorType()` helper, added `isAllocatorType` checks in both type conversion functions
- `src/codegen_test.zig` - Added test for `formatAllocatorType`, updated `dbg_var_val` test to expect noop
- `lib/tag.zig` - Removed obsolete `dbg_var_val` test, updated comments
- `lib/Inst.zig`, `lib/Context.zig` - Updated comments about dbg_var_val

**Test Case:** `test/cases/misc/allocator_in_struct.zig`

## Fix: slice_ptr must produce pointer to region (multi-item pointer)

**Date:** 2026-03-30

**Symptom:**
When running code that does pointer arithmetic on `slice.ptr` (e.g., `slice.ptr + 1`), the analysis incorrectly reported an error about pointer arithmetic on a single-item pointer.

**Root Cause:**
The `slice_ptr` handler was creating a pointer to a scalar instead of a pointer to a region. In Zig's type system:
- `*T` (single-item pointer) → pointer to scalar
- `[*]T` (multi-item pointer) → pointer to region

A slice is `[]T` which is represented as `pointer → region → element`. When you access `slice.ptr`, you get a `[*]T` (multi-item pointer), which should be `pointer → region`.

**When This Happens:**
When code extracts the `.ptr` from a slice and performs pointer arithmetic:
```zig
const slice: []const u8 = &data;
const ptr = slice.ptr;     // Should be [*]const u8 (multi-item)
const second = ptr + 1;    // ptr_add - only valid on multi-item pointers
```

**The Fix:**
The `slice_ptr` handler correctly creates a new pointer that points to the same region as the slice, not to the element. This was verified to be working correctly, but was missing a unit test.

**Unit Test:** `tag.test.slice_ptr produces pointer to region (multi-item pointer)` in `lib/tag.zig`
**Integration Test:** `test/cases/memory/slice_ptr_add.zig`

## Fix: struct_field_val must handle region fields

**Date:** 2026-03-21

**Symptom:**
When running the ForestMQ vendor wrapper, panic occurred: `struct_field_val: unexpected field refinement type region` in `checkFieldUndefined`.

**Root Cause:**
The `checkFieldUndefined` function in `lib/analysis/undefined_safety.zig` handles undefined checking for struct field values. It handled `.scalar`, `.pointer`, `.optional`, `.@"struct"`, and `.@"union"` types, but not `.region` (array/slice) types.

**When This Happens:**
When a struct contains an array field (like `buf: [32]u8`), extracting that field generates a `struct_field_val` instruction with a `.region` type. The Wyhash struct in stdlib has such array fields.

**The Fix:**
Added `.region` to the list of container types that don't track undefined on themselves (their elements carry the undefined state):

```zig
// Before:
.optional, .@"struct", .@"union" => {},

// After:
.optional, .@"struct", .@"union", .region => {},
```

**Test Case:** `test/cases/misc/struct_with_array_field.zig`

## Fix: Bitcast from [*]u8 to [*]Struct must convert region element type

**Date:** 2026-03-30

**Symptom:**
When running the HashMap vendor wrapper, false positive "use of undefined value" error occurred in `Metadata.isUsed` function even though the metadata had been initialized via `@memset`.

**Root Cause:**
HashMap allocates memory using `alignedAlloc(u8, ...)` which returns `[*]u8`, then bitcasts to `[*]Metadata`. The Bitcast handler was sharing the existing refinement when bitcasting between region pointers, which meant the region element type stayed as scalar instead of being converted to struct.

When `@memset` was called on the region, it marked the scalar element as defined. But when code accessed `.used` field on a metadata element, the analysis looked for struct fields on what was still a scalar refinement, found nothing, and incorrectly reported an undefined value.

**When This Happens:**
When code allocates raw bytes and bitcasts to a structured type:
```zig
const slice = allocator.alignedAlloc(u8, @alignOf(Metadata), size);
const metadata: [*]Metadata = @ptrCast(slice.ptr);
@memset(metadata[0..count], .{ .fingerprint = 0, .used = false });
if (metadata[0].used) { ... }  // False positive: "use of undefined value"
```

**The Fix:**
Modified the `Bitcast.apply` handler in `lib/tag.zig` to detect when bitcasting a pointer to region of scalars to a pointer to region of structs. When this happens:
1. Create a new struct element refinement with the correct field structure
2. Copy the undefined state from the source scalar to all struct fields
3. Create a new region pointing to the new struct element
4. Create a new pointer pointing to the new region

Added helper function `copyUndefinedStateFromScalarToStruct` to propagate undefined state from scalar to struct fields recursively.

**Unit Test:** `tag.test.bitcast converts [*]u8 to [*]Struct region element type` in `lib/tag.zig`
**Integration Test:** `test/cases/misc/bitcast_scalar_to_struct.zig`, `test/integration/misc.bats`

## Fix: Clear source allocation tracking when bitcast creates new region

**Date:** 2026-03-30

**Symptom:**
False positive memory leak reported when using HashMap-style pointer arithmetic pattern. Allocating `[Header][Data]` as bytes, storing a derived pointer (`ptr + sizeof(Header)`) to an optional field, then freeing via reverse arithmetic (`ptr - sizeof(Header)`) incorrectly reported a memory leak.

**Root Cause:**
When bitcast converts `[*]u8` to `?[*]Metadata` (optional pointer to region of structs), it creates NEW refinement entities (pointer → region → struct) with memory_safety.allocated copied from the source. However, the SOURCE region still had memory_safety.allocated with freed=null.

The leak detector found two regions with allocated state:
1. Source region (from original slice_ptr/ptr_add) with allocated, freed=null
2. New region (from bitcast type conversion) with allocated, freed=null

Only the new region's pointer was stored to self.metadata. When the allocate function returned, the source region was detected as a leak because it had allocated state but wasn't stored anywhere.

**When This Happens:**
When code stores a bitcast'd pointer that required type conversion:
```zig
const slice = allocator.alloc(u8, total_size);
const ptr: [*]u8 = slice.ptr;
const data_ptr = ptr + @sizeOf(Header);  // Derived pointer
self.metadata = @ptrCast(@alignCast(data_ptr));  // Bitcast to ?[*]Struct
// Source region (data_ptr) still has allocated state → false positive leak
```

**The Fix:**
After creating the new region with copied memory_safety during bitcast type conversion, clear the SOURCE region's memory_safety (set to null). The new region now owns the allocation tracking, so the source should not be tracked. This uses connectivity tracking - the allocation is only tracked via the new region which is reachable through self.metadata.

Added helper function `clearAllocationTracking` in `lib/tag.zig` that sets memory_safety to null on a region.

Also fixed `copyAnalyteStateFromScalarToStruct` to only copy memory_safety (not undefined_safety) to struct containers, since structs cannot have undefined_safety at the container level.

**Unit Tests:** 
- `tag.test.ptr_sub on pointer to region returns pointer to same region`
- `tag.test.ptr_add on pointer to region returns pointer to same region`
- `tag.test.bitcast from [*]T to *T preserves region structure`

**Integration Tests:** 
- `test/cases/memory/optional_ptr_arithmetic_free.zig`
- `test/cases/memory/ptr_arithmetic_free.zig`
- `test/integration/allocator_slice.bats`
